  What will happen during the test?

<section class="page-content">
  You will go through {{ testCount }} similar matching tasks.
  <br><br>
  During each task you will be presented with an audio recording in three variants - thus three audio recordings to listen to during each task.
  <br><br>
  Those variants differ in acoustic scenes they represent (described on the next page).
  <br><br>
  Your objective is to listen to the audio recordings variants and match them with the acoustic scenes you think they represent (an example of the matching process is shown further in the test).
